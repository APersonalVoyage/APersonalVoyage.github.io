        <h1>Why Does India Struggle with Civic Sense? A Historical, Cultural, and Personal Perspective</h1>
        <p>Civic sense—broadly defined as an individual's awareness and responsibility toward public spaces and community welfare—plays a critical role in shaping a society. It reflects how people interact with their surroundings and the extent to which they respect the social fabric.</p>
        <p>In India, however, the lack of civic sense is a pervasive issue. From littering in streets to vandalism of public property, the symptoms are evident everywhere. This article explores the historical and cultural roots of this problem, tying in my personal experiences to understand why civic sense remains elusive.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical Foundations of Civic Apathy</h2>
        <h3>Colonial Rule and the Legacy of Alienation</h3>
        <p>The colonial period profoundly impacted India's relationship with public spaces and governance. Under British rule, cities were often segregated, with the colonial elite enjoying well-maintained areas, while the masses had limited access to such amenities.</p>
        
        <h3>Monarchical Systems and Hierarchical Structures</h3>
        <p>Even before colonial rule, India's monarchical systems were built on rigid hierarchies. Public welfare initiatives, such as the construction of roads or reservoirs, were often undertaken for the ruler's prestige rather than community benefit.</p>
        
        <h2>A First-Hand Encounter with Civic Apathy</h2>
        <p>Having lived in the UK for a period, where public spaces are well-maintained and rules are largely followed, my recent visit to the local vegetable market in my hometown offered a stark contrast.</p>
        <p>The market was a microcosm of the civic challenges India faces: litter scattered everywhere, vendors and shoppers seemingly indifferent, and men urinating in public. This behavior seemed normalized, likely stemming from a patriarchal mindset where public spaces are treated as extensions of personal domains.</p>
        
        <h2>A Visit to the Temples: A Sacred Space Polluted</h2>
        <p>Another recent experience was visiting temples in India, where I expected serenity but instead found plastic wrappers, food waste, and discarded offerings. The contradiction between faith and civic responsibility was striking.</p>
        
        <h2>Behavioral Patterns and Cultural Mindsets</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Bystander Effect:</strong> People assume someone else will take responsibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Sense of Futility:</strong> Many believe individual efforts won’t make a difference.</li>
            <li><strong>Normalization of Public Apathy:</strong> Acts like littering or urinating in public are so common they are not seen as problematic.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Colonial Hangover or Broader Patterns?</h2>
        <p>The lack of civic sense in India is likely due to a combination of colonial legacy, social structures like caste and patriarchy, rapid urbanization, and inadequate civic education.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding the lack of civic sense in India requires examining its historical, cultural, and behavioral dimensions. While this article does not focus on solutions, it aims to provoke thought: How did we get here, and can we change our perspective toward public spaces?</p>
