      <p>
        Throughout history, humans have wrestled with the question of leadership. From tribal chiefs to divine kings, rulers have shaped societies in profound ways. 
        But has this power always been a force for good? Or has it often been the source of chaos and inequality? By exploring the timeless themes in Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, 
        and the philosophies that underpin leadership, morality, and power, we can find insights into the challenges we face even today.
        <h4>A Young Man’s Moral Struggle</h4> 
        Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment tells the story of Raskolnikov, a young man who murders a pawnbroker in cold blood. He believes the act is justified; by killing her, 
        he can take her money and use it for the greater good. His reasoning is utilitarian—focused on maximizing benefits for the majority. 
        But what seems logical in theory begins to unravel.Haunted by guilt and paranoia, 
        Raskolnikov’s once-clear rationale falters. His illness, hallucinations, and self-imposed isolation show us that even the most calculated justifications can crumble under the weight of morality. 
        It is through Sonya, a compassionate woman who lives a life of self-sacrifice, that he begins to see the truth: no amount of intellectual reasoning can erase the value of a single human life. 
        In the end, his confession and punishment in Siberia offer a path to redemption, not because society demands it, but because his soul yearns for it.
        <h4>The Flaws of Utilitarian Thinking</h4>
        Raskolnikov’s story resonates because it exposes a flaw in utilitarianism, 
        the idea that an action is justified if it produces the greatest good for the greatest number. 
        On the surface, this philosophy seems fair and logical. But when taken to extremes, it can justify exploitation, 
        inequality, and even harm—so long as it serves a larger purpose.
        Consider today’s billionaires, who hold vast amounts of wealth while millions struggle to meet basic needs. 
        Their defenders often argue that their innovations benefit society, creating jobs and driving progress. 
        But is it fair for so much wealth and power to rest in the hands of so few? Dostoevsky would likely say no. 
        Just as Raskolnikov’s crime couldn’t be justified by his lofty intentions, the concentration of resources in the hands of a few cannot erase the suffering it perpetuates.
